## Overview
This project is meant to be used with Nexpose. It provides a docker
image that when run, provides an endpoint that can be called with a
Site ID for a site that was recently scanned. The service will query the
Nexpose API with the Scan ID in order to get a list of assets that are
in that site, then produce each individual asset on an event stream.

This project is a part of a bigger project to Automate Nexpose Vulnerability
Scan results. The idea is that once a scan is run, the scan ID can be sent
to this nexpose-asset-producer, then once the nexpose-asset-producer puts
the asset on the event stream, it can be hydrated with vulnerability
information, including vulnerability details and solutions, which also
need to be queried from the Nexpose API, so that you can find out which
 vulnerabilities exist in your assets and how to fix them.

### Environment Variables
Here are the environment variables that need to be set

| Name                  | Required | Description                                                                          | Example                       |
|-----------------------|:--------:|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| NEXPOSE_API_HOST      |   Yes    | Scheme and host for the Nexpose instance                                             | https://nexpose.mycompany.com |
| NEXPOSE_API_USERNAME  |   Yes    | Username to access the Nexpose instance                                              | myusername                    |
| NEXPOSE_API_PASSWORD  |   Yes    | Password that corresponds to the provided username                                   | mypassword                    |
| NEXPOSE_PAGESIZE      |    No    | The number of Nexpose assets to get back at a time (default 100)                     | 100                           |
| HTTPPRODUCER_API_HOST |   Yes    | Scheme and host for the HTTP event producer (i.e., Benthos connected to SQS/Kinesis) | http://benthos:4195           |

### Dependency Check
Depending on the user, this service or app can be composed of a bunch of sidecars. While one can check whether the configuration and
placement of these sidecars are configured correctly internally it might be useful to check whether environment variables point
to the correct external dependencies.

An obvious external dependency would be Nexpose itself. There is a baked in dependency check within `assetfetcher`, to which
users can check whether they are able to connect to Nexpose with `/dependencycheck`(example in `gateway-incoming.yaml`).

and the interfaces are subject to change.

### Building And Testing

We publish a docker image called [SDCLI](https://github.com/asecurityteam/sdcli) that
bundles all of our build dependencies. It is used by the included Makefile to help make
building and testing a bit easier. The following actions are available through the Makefile:

-   make dep

    Install the project dependencies into a vendor directory

-   make lint

    Run our static analysis suite

-   make test

    Run unit tests and generate a coverage artifact

-   make integration

    Run integration tests and generate a coverage artifact

-   make coverage

    Report the combined coverage for unit and integration tests

-   make build

    Generate a local build of the project (if applicable)

-   make run

    Run a local instance of the project (if applicable)

-   make doc

    Generate the project code documentation and make it viewable
    locally.

### Quality Gates

Our build process will run the following checks before going green:

-   make lint
-   make test
-   make integration
-   make coverage (combined result must be 85% or above for the project)

Running these locally, will give early indicators of pass/fail.
